# AWS Labs

These labs are intended to help you walk through a simple example of an interactive site built on top of AWS technologies.

To run these labs, you will need the following:

* Personal AWS account (created in Lab #1 if you don't have one)
* A text editor of some form (I use Visual Studio Code)
* A modern browser (many of the labs will not work with Internet Explorer)
* Python 3.6 (available from python.org)

The current labs available are:

* [Lab 1](labs/lab-1.md) - Getting Started
* [Lab 2](labs/lab-2.md) - Intro to S3
